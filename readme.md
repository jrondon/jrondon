## About Me

Hello, I'm Jhonatan Rond√≥n, a technology professional with over a decade of experience leading teams, developing software, and helping businesses maximize the potential of technology. My diverse industry and role experience, from Software Developer to CTO, enables me to offer unique and valuable perspectives to my clients.

My approach is about truly understanding your needs and challenges to provide tailored and effective solutions. I believe the success of any project lies in the 'feeling' of the team and a deep understanding of needs, rather than just selling consulting hours.

My services include systems architecture consulting, agile software development, tech project leadership, team training, and more. I'm ready to help you take your business to the next level and make the most of the opportunities that technology offers.

If you're ready to explore how we might work together, I would love to have a conversation with you. Let's talk and see how I can bring value to your business!
